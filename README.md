# Gradio demo app for Binary Classification using Gated Residual and Variable Selection Networks

This demo app demonstrates the use of Gated Residual Networks (GRN) and Variable Selection Networks (VSN), proposed by Bryan Lim et al. in [Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363) for structured data classification
